QUESTIONS:

1. What is the order of growth of  n^3+n^2 ? What about 1000000n^3 + n^2? What about n^3 + 1000000n^2?

2. What is the order of growth of (n^2+n)⋅(n+1)? Before you start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading term.

3. If f is in O(g), for some unspecified function g, what can we say about af + b, where a and b are constants?

4. If f1 and f2 are in O(g), what can we say about f1 + f2?

5. If f1 is in O(g) and f2 is in O(h), what can we say about f1 + f2?

6. If f1 is in O(g) and f2 is in O(h), what can we say about f1 ⋅ f2?

7. What is a "comparison sort?" What is the best worst-case order of growth for a comparison sort? What is the best worst-case order of growth for any sort algorithm?

8. What is the order of growth of bubble sort, and why does Barack Obama think it is "the wrong way to go?"

9. What is the order of growth of radix sort? What preconditions do we need to use it?

10. What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?

11. What is the worst sorting algorithm (that has a name)?

12. What sort algorithm does the C library use? What sort algorithm does Python use? Are these algorithms stable? You might have to Google around to find these answers.

13. Many of the non-comparison sorts are linear, so why does Python use an  O(nlog(n))  comparison sort?

ANSWERS:
1. All of these have the same order of growth: O(n^3)

2. O(n^3)

3. af + b is in O(g)

4. f1 + f2 is in O(g)

5. f1 + f2 is in either O(g) or O(h) (depending on which one is "worse")

6. f1 ⋅ f2 is in O(gh)
